<p class="alert alert-info"><strong>Saptashrungi is a hill range situated 60 km from Nashik and forms a part of the Sahyadri range. It is a blend of the Sanskrit words 'sapta' which means seven and 'shrung' which means peak. These majestic hills have amongst them 108 bodies of water which are called kundas, which greatly add to the beauty of the hills. Not only are the hills incredible to look at, but the forests on the hills are loaded with medicinal herbs. In fact, as per the Hindu tradition, when Laxman was lying unconscious and could only be awakened by the 'sanjeevani' herb, Lord Hanuman flew to these hills in search of the herb.

The Saptashrungi temple is also situated in the hill range. This temple is held in high accords by the Hindu traditions. The traditions indicate that the great goddess Saptashrungi Nivasini dwells right between the seven hills. In fact, Lord Ram along with Seeta and Laxman had come to these hills themselves to seek the great goddess' blessings.</strong></p>
